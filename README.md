This project is a **Sign-Up Page** built using **Django**, which allows users to register by entering a username and password. The page is designed with a **modern and responsive UI**, ensuring a smooth user experience. The implementation follows Django's authentication system and includes **CSRF protection** for security.

## How to Execute the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   First, download the project from GitHub using the `git clone` command. Then, navigate to the project directory.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:  
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately. This can be done using Python’s `venv` module.

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This ensures that all necessary packages are available.

4. **Apply Migrations**:  
   Before running the application, database migrations should be applied using:  
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   This sets up the necessary database tables.

5. **Run the Development Server**:  
   The application can be started using Django’s built-in development server by running:  
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Once the server is running, the **Sign-Up Page** can be accessed through a web browser at:  
   **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**
